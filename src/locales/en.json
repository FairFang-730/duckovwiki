            "q2": "Does the game have native controller support?",
            "a2": "Not officially. As of Patch v1.3.12, Escape From Duckov does not have native controller support. However, it is rated \"Playable\" on Steam Deck by using community layouts (Steam Input) to map WASD controls to joysticks.",
            "q3": "Where is the save file location?",
            "a3": "Your save data is located at: %AppData%\\LocalLow\\TeamSoda\\Duckov\\Saves. Tip: The game has a built-in \"Restore Backup\" feature in the main menu if your save gets corrupted.",
            "q4": "What happens when I die?",
            "a4": "You will lose all loot in your backpack and equipped gear. However, your Hideout upgrades, unlocked Blueprints, and Skill Tree progression are permanent. This \"Roguelite\" twist allows you to become stronger even after failed extractions.",
            "q5": "How do I fix the \"Pink Texture\" glitch?",
            "a5": "This is a known issue with older GPU drivers. Please update your drivers or verify the integrity of game files via Steam. If the issue persists, try disabling \"Rim Light\" in the graphics settings."
