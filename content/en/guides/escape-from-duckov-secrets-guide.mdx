## Escape from Duckov Secrets: Farm Phone Codes, J-Lab Hidden Room & Blueprints

## Q1: Farm Town Phone Booth Codes & Rewards

> **Quick Answer:** **3825 (#DUCK)** = Candy Gun. **1984** = Ammo Recipe.

### Location & Safe Approach

The Phone Booths are located in the **Market Square**, right next to the ruined Church. This is a "Hot Zone" for PvP.

* **Strategy:** Approach from the **Graveyard** side. Crouch-walk through the bushes. The phone booth rings loudly when you interact, covering your footsteps but alerting nearby players.

### The "666" Night Event

If you dial **666** at night (22:00 - 04:00), a mini-boss named **"The Butcher"** spawns.
* **Loot:** He drops the **"Cleaver" melee weapon** (high bleed chance).
* **Difficulty:** Very High. He runs faster than you. Have a teammate ready with a shotgun.

## Q2: J-Lab Hidden Bookshelf Walkthrough

> **Quick Answer:** Needs **Intelligence 15**. Interact with **Blue Book** on 2nd Floor Admin Building.

### Detailed Pathing (Step-by-Step)

Getting to the J-Lab Admin Building is harder than opening the door. Here is the safest route:

1.  **Spawn:** Enter via the "Loading Bay" spawn.
2.  **Stealth:** Avoid the main hallway (turrets are active). Crawl through the **Ventilation Shaft** on the left wall.
3.  **The Room:** Once in the Admin Office (Room 204), kill the two "Security Ducks" inside.
4.  **The Trigger:** The Blue Book is on the middle shelf. If your Intelligence is < 15, the character will say "I don't get it" and nothing happens.

### Loot Table: What's Inside?

This room is the best way to farm money.

## Q3: The Flamethrower & The Shovel Bug

> **Quick Answer:** **Ground Zero** -> **Radar Tower** -> **Cave on Right**. Use **Shovel**.

### How to get a Shovel?

You cannot craft a shovel. You must find it.
* **Best Spawn:** Check the trunks of cars in the **Parking Lot** area.
* **Alternative:** Kill "Gravedigger Ducks" near the Church. They drop shovels 20% of the time.

### Troubleshooting: "Why can't I dig?"

Many players report interacting with the rocks but nothing happens.
1.  **Reason 1:** You are in combat. You cannot dig while an enemy is targeting you.
2.  **Reason 2:** Durability. Your shovel must have at least **10/50 Durability**. Broken shovels won't work.
3.  **Reason 3:** Already looted. If the rocks are already gone, someone beat you to it.
